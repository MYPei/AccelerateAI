AccelerateAI is a compute cluster designed to enable high-speed Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning computations, by making use of latest-generation
NVIDIA A100 GPUs. It is available to all researchers at Swansea, Aberystwyth, Bangor,
and Cardiff Universities, free at the point of use.

Research outputs (e.g. conference talks, papers) presenting work enabled by
AccelerateAI should include, where possible, the ERDF logo above. Where this
is not possible, they **must** include as an acknowledgement at least the text:
"AccelerateAI is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund through
the Welsh Government".
